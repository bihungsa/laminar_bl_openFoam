# laminar_bl_openFoam
This is laminar boundary layer using icoFoam solver

The boundary conditions in the U file are 
zero gradient on the top and bottom of the entrance region
constant velocity on the left side of entrance region.
zero gradient on the top of the flat plate region and right hand side
no slip condition on bottom of flat plate region
